There will be two Wildcard companies and each will have to choose a different area in which to create their company. In case that both Wildcard teams want the same type of company, an audit with the FELC Student Board and their company staff will take place (Company Designation), in which they will both explain the reasons they want that particular type of company. The Student Board and company staff will determine the distribution of companies between both Wildcard teams depending on the outcome of the audit. </p>
